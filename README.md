# SI 618 Course Work
My course work from SI 618: Data Manipulation and Analysis at the University of Michigan from Fall 2017.

The course was taught by Ceren Budak from the University of Michigan School of Information program. 

All course work was provided by Dr. Budak and the University of Michigan. Course work was in the form of labs, homework assignments and an end of the semester project. While all the work throughout this semester is my own work, I do not own the material provided. **It should not be used to copy for future semesters of this course.**

Topics of this course were:

* Fetching and parsing web content and API's
* Using SQLite to query SQL databases
* Big data processing using Hadoop, MapReduce and Spark
* Crowdsourcing using Amazon MTurk
* Data Exploration and manipulation in R using data.table and ggplot
* Clustering data analysis in R
* Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis in R
* Outlier Detection

Data Camp was used heavily for many labs assignments. Through the course of the semester, I completed: Introduction and Intermidiate R, Introduction and Data Visualization with ggplot, Introduction and Intermidiate to data.table and Time Series Analysis.
